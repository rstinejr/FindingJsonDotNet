# FindingJsonDotNet

I'm reaquaiting myself with C# and learning the new ASP.NET Core.  Finding a good library for JSON serialization/deserialization was harder than I expected, so I thought I'd document how I did it.

First off, for instructions on downloading and installing free Visual Studio and Open Source ASP.NET Core, see https://dotnet.github.io/.

To build this package:

1. If on Windows, download and install VisualStudio 2015 rev 3.
2. Install ASP.Net Core
3. ```git clone git@github.com:rstinejr/FindingJsonDotNet.git```
4. ```cd FindingJsonDotNet```
5. ```dotnet restore```
6. ```dotnet build```.  Or, to build and run, ```dotnet run```
