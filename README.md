# FindingJsonDotNet

I'm reaquaiting myself with C# and learning the new ASP.NET Core.  Finding a good library for JSON serialization/deserialization was harder than I expected, so I thought I'd document how I did it.

First off, for instructions on downloading and installing free Visual Studio and Open Source ASP.NET Core, see https://dotnet.github.io/.
